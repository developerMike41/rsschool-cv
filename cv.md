## About me
Hi! I started learning programming two years ago. And since then I realized that the code is mine. If I was asked to change something (not to code), I would not agree. I consider that a programmer should learn by himself. So I am looking for all the information by myself. My goal is to get a job in an IT company, and I will work hard for this.
