## About me
Hi! I started learning programming two years ago. And since then I realized that the code is mine. If I was asked to change something (not to code), I would not agree. I consider that a programmer should learn by himself. So I am looking for all the information by myself. My goal is to get a job in an IT company, and I will work hard for this.

        acc[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
            this.classList.toggle("active");
            var panel = this.nextElementSibling;
            if (panel.style.maxHeight){
                panel.style.maxHeight = null;
            } else {
                panel.style.maxHeight = panel.scrollHeight + "px";
